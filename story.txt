According to my ECON 301 textbook--
When the price of a good changes, there are two sorts of effects: the rate at which you can exchange one good for another changes, and the total purchasing power of your income is altered. If, for example, good 1 becomes cheaper, it means that you have to give up less good 2 to purchase good 1. The change in htethe price of good 1 has changed the rate at which hte market allows you to "substitute" good 2 for good 1. The trade-off between the two goods that the market presents the consumer has changed.  

I have not taken an economics class in my life. I do not understand any of this.

One day, after I have taken many economics classes, I hope to understand this quote and many more. I hope that I can become a successful inverstor and move to New York.

According to the law of economics: As Guy Fieri AS the demand for hot sauce goes up, profits for his show go up. I have never studies economics. so i assume you know more. BUT GUY FIERI IS GOD. Dont question him

In highschool, I took an economics class, it was NOT fun at all. Sometimes we played monopoly though, which was the only fun part of the class. I like being the tophat character!

Wow thanks guys! Great to know your relationships with economics! (And yes, demand goes up, profits would likely to go up too:)
