According to my ECON 301 textbook--
When the price of a good changes, there are two sorts of effects: the rate at which you can exchange one good for another changes, and the total purchasing power of your income is altered. If, for example, good 1 becomes cheaper, it means that you have to give up less good 2 to purchase good 1. The change in htethe price of good 1 has changed the rate at which hte market allows you to "substitute" good 2 for good 1. The trade-off between the two goods that the market presents the consumer has changed.
